                        My name is Andrew Koster. I was born in Johns Creek, GA and have lived hear my whole life.
                        I have recently decided to make a career change from being a civil engineer to become a 
                        wed developer. I am currently studying HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, JQuery, NodeJS, Git,
                        React, and so much more. I love to code and create new ideas. I also love going to the gym, 
                        watching football, playing basketball, traveling, and going out with friends.
